    1. Added ALT Tags to all images
       I have tested this by using both inspector to check the NAME of the image under the accessibility section AND
       I switched off images within google chrome by opening  chrome://settings/content/images and using the option
       Don't allow sites to show images, and the alt tags were displayed in the place of the images.

    2. I spent a long time wondering about the background image within the CSS, if it should have an ALT tag. I have researched this 
       extensively, and I am of the following view:

            "CSS background images which are by definition only of aesthetic value - not visual content of the document itself. If you
            need to put an image in the page that has meaning then use an IMG element and give it an alternative test in the alt attribute."

    3. Changed DIV tags for 
            header
            main
            aside
            footer
            
            also introduced
            section
            article
            
    4. Changed the H2 tag within the footer to H4 to ensure the flow of H is correct througout the page

    5. Added ID to search-engine-optimization SECTION as it was not there previously therefore the NAV would not WORK
