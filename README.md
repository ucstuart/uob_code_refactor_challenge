# Code Refactor Challenge

## Introduction

This challenge highlights my understanding of the following concepts:

    1.  Documenting the HTML Code and CSS Style Sheet
    2.  Using Semantic HTML to provide a structure to the HTML, which is useful for both Web Accessibility and also Search Engine Optimisation, as well as making the code more readable. 
    3.  Refactoring the CSS to consolidate CSS Styles to make the CSS more efficent, manageable and readable.
